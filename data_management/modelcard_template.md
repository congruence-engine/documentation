- **Model type:** 
- **Language(s) (NLP):** 
- **License:** 
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:**

- **Repository:** 
- **Paper [optional]:** 
- **Demo [optional]:** 

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->


### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->


### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->


## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->


### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->


## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.


## Training Details

### Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->


### Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

#### Preprocessing [optional]



#### Training Hyperparameters  [optional]




#### Speeds, Sizes, Times [optional]

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->


## Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card if possible. -->


#### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->


#### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->


### Results


#### Summary

{{ results_summary | default("", true) }}

## Environmental Impact

<!-- Total emissions (in grams of CO2eq) and additional considerations, such as electricity usage, go here. Edit the suggested text below accordingly -->

Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).



## Technical Specifications [optional]

### Model Architecture and Objective


### Compute Infrastructure


#### Hardware


#### Software


## Citation 

<!-- If there is a paper or blog post introducing the model, the APA and Bibtex information for that should go in this section. -->
