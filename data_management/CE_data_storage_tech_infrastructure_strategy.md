# The Congruence Engine: technical infrastructure and data management  
## V.0.3 | 11 October  2022
## Authors: Anna-Maria Sichani , Jamie Unwin, John Stack, Arran Rees 

## Overall Goal 
Goal of this document is to describe the overall Congruence Engine’s technical infrastructure  strategy, including hosting, storage and preservation provision for the project’s  documentation, datasets and outputs. 

### Platforms/Services employed  

#### GitHub 
A public version of the CE GitHub Repository will be used for all public project-generated  data/outputs, including 
1. datasets * 
2. prototypes’ code  
3. project’s public-facing documentation and reports (in line with the Publishing WG  guidelines, TBC) 
4. training material  

*Project partners’ datasets are normally shared with the project under open licences such as  CC0 - public domain data or CC-BY-SA (Attribution-Share Alike). Under these licences, data  can be further processed and openly published in our CE Github repo. Where the data  provider specifically claims a different copyright for their data, their dataset will remain in the  private Github repo. Licensing should be made clear for all datasets. 
A private GitHub Repo will be used mainly for datasets that are without open licences and  for raw data from partners. 

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
We do not plan to use this service in the first place , as this would require resources we do  not intend to invest in, but we consider it as an option if and when the data demands it (while  experimenting with ML).  

#### SMG public-facing website 
Project’s prototypes, data-related outputs and project-specific updates will be hosted in a  dedicated-SMG website https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/project/the-congruence engine/ . This will be the central place for the project showcasing and communicating its  findings in an accessible way, following also TaNC- AHRC requirements for publicly accessible  outputs. 

#### Zotero  
A Zotero library has been set up, currently having a number of sub libraries, to store project’s  bibliography.  

#### Basecamp  
Basecamp , currently hosted by MadLab (500GB storage included in our fee) is used for  day-to-day communication of team members, general storage, updates and networking. A  backup strategy of its contents must be in place. 

#### OneDrive and GoogleDrive/docs 
Cloud services such as OneDrive and GoogleDrive are used in everyday communication mainly  for sharing documentation and facilitating meetings and discussions. Some of these documents  will end up as project’s documentation hosted in the Public GitHub repo.
